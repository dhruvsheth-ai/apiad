I recently discovered that Twitter can be an amazing place to share short, actionable pieces of content that convey one specific message. These are topics that I haven't developed enough to become an essay, and probably never will, but I still find them interesting and worthy of sharing.

Not everything I write on Twitter is saved here, only those pieces of content that have enough value I think someone might be interested in bookmarking.

If you want to read more thoughtful stuff, I also have some [short essays](../essays) where I take a longer time to explore more complex ideas.
