These are short and actionable messages that I often post to Twitter.
Not everything I write on Twitter is saved here, only those pieces of content that have enough value I think someone might be interested in bookmarking.

If you want to read more thoughtful stuff, I also have some [short essays](../essays) where I take a longer time to explore more complex ideas.
