I recently discovered that Twitter can be an amazing place to share short, actionable pieces of content that convey one specific message. These are topics that I haven't developed enough to become an essay, and probably never will, but I still find them interesting and worthy of sharing.

Not everything I write on Twitter is saved here, only those pieces of content that have enough value I think someone might be interested in bookmarking. But this content is only the tip of the iceberg, the real value is in the conversation they spark on Twitter. So, after reading them, make sure to click on the embedded tweet at the end which will take you to the thread on Twitter, and there you'll find a lot of opinions, discussion, and insights.

If you want to read more thoughtful stuff, I also have some [short essays](../essays) where I take a longer time to explore more complex ideas.
