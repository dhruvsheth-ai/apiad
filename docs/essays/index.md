This is a collection of some things I've written over the years. Instead of blog posts, I consider them kind of short essays. These are varied in format and content, some are more technical, some are more philosophical, others a bit more pragmatic. 

I honestly don't like to write
tutorial-like articles. I've tried a bunch of times and I've failed (though I might try again in the future). For now, I think there are enough amazing people out there doing it much better than I. 

Hence, these short essays are not about specific technologies or how-to guides. I try to select topics I'm passionate about and that I think have a chance to remain relevant for a longer time. If there is a particular topic you think I might have something interesting to say about, feel free to [contact me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/AlejandroPiad). 

I've also recently started to post short, actionable stuff in the form of [tweetstorm](../tweetstorms). 
These are threads of 10-20 tweets that I'm also collecting here for future reference.
