This is a collection of some things I've written over the years. Instead of blog posts, I consider them kind of short essays.

They are varied in format and content, some are more technical, some are more philosophical. I don't really like to write
tutorial-like articles. I think there are enough amazing people out there doing it much better than I.

For the shortest, actionable stuff, I've currently started to [tweetstorm](../tweetstorms). 
These are threads of 10-20 tweets that I'm also collecting here for future reference.
