Here are some of the most interesting projects I'm working on:

## AutoGOAL

AutoGOAL is a Python framework for Automated Machine Learning that I and a few other colleagues are building.
It's the main research result of my [wife's PhD](https://github.com/sestevez), and it is a team project in which I'm a proud contributor and evangelist.

## Auditorium

Auditorium is my attempt to bring together Python with HTML for interactive slideshows. It is based on [reveal.js](https://revealjs.org) and allows creating a slideshow with pure Python code, including some interactive stuff like rendering graphs on the fly and running animations.

## Illiterate

Illiterate is my take at the dilemma of code comments vs documentation. The idea stems from my love for the [Literate Programming](http://literateprogramming.com/) paradigm, but with a pragmatic twist that doesn't require any external tooling but rather relies on discipline and conventions.
